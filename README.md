### About Me
I am a high schooler who wants to have a future within computer science. Before any schooling, I have always wanted to code, and I started to dabble in Lua because of Garry's Mod. As of right now I have only taken Computer Science A which taught me basic coding practices and Java, overall the beginning was pretty easy because of my initial coding knowledge but learning Java opened a few doors for me. Garry's Mod was a huge part of my childhood it's where I spent nearly 7000 hours of my childhood on whether it was TTT, DarkRP, Deathrun, etc. hearing about S&Box made me want to take a more developer oriented approach to it compared to what I did on gmod, this lead to me learning C# and basic developing principles.
